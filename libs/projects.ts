            "Our team has developed a web application designed to enhance the security of Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity. Recognizing the growing importance of blockchain technologies and the need for robust smart contract security, our application examines and scans Solidity files to ensure the smart contracts are safe, efficient, and scalable. By leveraging a machine learning model, our application takes into account gas fees, optimizing the smart contracts for cost-effectiveness.",

            "Through a user-friendly interface, users can conveniently provide a link to the Solidity file they wish to analyze. Our application then subjects the file to a comprehensive examination by our machine learning model, which is trained to identify patterns and signatures associated with four types of vulnerabilities. The analysis results are presented on a dedicated Result Page, offering a detailed breakdown of potential vulnerabilities and their respective severity levels, enabling users to address identified issues effectively.",
